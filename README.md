## rio-prettyprint

`rio-prettyprint` is a Haskell package that provides a library that combines the logging
capabilities of the [`rio` package](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio) with the pretty
printing capabilities of the 
[`annotated-wl-pprint` package](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/annotated-wl-pprint).
Documents can be annotated with an optional style from a set of named styles, and the
style associated with each named style can be specified as a list of ANSI Select Graphic
Rendition (SGR) commands. These commands are represented by the constructors of a type
provided by the 
[`ansi-terminal-types` package](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ansi-terminal-types)

The library also provides:
* a type that represents a simple, non-customisable environments that provide pretty logging
  functionality; and
* a type that represents pretty exceptions.
